First, let’s answer the following question: What the heck is this blog for?

The short and sweet answer is that this blog attempts to teach computer science concepts in a way that is understandable to everyone. The long answer, however, is that this blog attempts to do something a tad more ambitious.

The field of computer science has been seeing unprecedented popularity in recent years. A report from the University of Washington in 2014 shows an exponential increase in the number of undergraduate university students that demonstrate interest in computer science [insert UW majors graph here]. Similar trends have been observed in STEM programs across the United States. Such trends correlate with the increase in computer science related jobs—in 2013, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that “62% of the growth in jobs in science-related fields will be in computer science” . Furthermore, non-profit organizations such as Code.org have appeared address this overwhelming demand for computer science education. In terms of available resources and opportunities, there has never been a better time to study computer science.

And yet, there is still a major issue that (as far as I am aware) has not been effectively addressed: the way that computer science is generally perceived. What I mean by this is that the majority of people have an incomplete (if not incorrect) idea of what computer science is. 

So…why is this a problem?

This is more than a simple philosophical issue. The most concerning consequence of this is that the wrong idea of computer science drive people away from learning computer science. This especially poses a problem in promoting gender diversity in the field, as less than 20% of computer science degrees are awarded to women. One university conducted a survey and found that over 50% of women studying computer science had never considered computer science for a major or career prior to taking the introductory course (Okay, this one is from the University of Washington as well. What can I say? I’m a UW CSE alum! Check out this awesome paper that presents a case for women in computer science.). The reason that this is the case is largely due to a misunderstanding of what computer science really is about. Computer science is so much more than coding, building apps, and making websites.

So if computer science isn’t any of those things, what is it? Now that I have elaborated on my motivation, I encourage you to get started by reading my first blog post! And I hope that you will leave this blog feeling with a greater understanding of the captivating field of computer science.
